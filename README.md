# URL-Keyword-Monitor

Just a very rudimentary python script to monitor change of a web page.

Monitor a particular web page determined by the user. If user-determined keyword(s) change is detected at the webpage, the programme will send an alert to the user-set email address when the computer is connected to the internet.
